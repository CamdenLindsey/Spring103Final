# Spring103Final
Game Description:

This game is a button-mashing race between two players, using the buttons A and B on the CPX board to see who can reach a higher number before the timer runs out. The timer countdown will play for 15 seconds, and the goal is to have more mashes than your opponent. There will be a starting chime and light display to start the game, and when one player wins, the respective light display and sound for their specific button will play. The serial monitor will display the final number count for each and the difference between the buttons to show which side won. After displaying the results, the board will go back into idle mode, and players can start up new match. 


Game Rules:

If you press your button during the light display/starting chime, you will auto lose that round.

The two players will play best out of 5 matches to determine the winner.
